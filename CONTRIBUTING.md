# Contributing
You can contribute with issues and pull requests (PRs). Simply logging issues for any problems you encounter is a great way to contribute. Contributing code is greatly appreciated.

## Where to report issues
New issues can be reported in the project [issue list](../../../Issues).

Before logging a new issue, please search the list of issues to make sure it doesn't already exist.

If an existing issue for it does already exist, please include your own feedback in that existing issue's discussion and consider upvoting (👍 reaction) the original post. 

## Writing a good bug report
A good bug report makes it easier for maintainers to verify the issue and identify the root cause. Ideally, the following should be included:
- high level description of the problem
- a minimal reproduction of the issue
- description of the expected behaviour
- any known workarounds
- any other additional information you feel may be relevant

## Contributing changes
Project maintainers will merge accepted code changes from contributors.

## Dos and Don'ts
Do's:
- **DO** following the coding conventions and style that is in place in the project.
- **DO** include tests when adding new functionality.
- **DO** start by adding a test when addressing a bug, that highlights the current broken behaviour.
- **DO** help keep discussions on issues focused. When new or related topic comes up, consider raising a new issue rather than side-tracking another.
- **DO** prefer smaller PRs that cover single, discrete enhancements instead of large PRs that combine a wider set of changes.

Don'ts:
- **DON'T** submit PRs that alter licensing relating files or headers
- **DON'T** submit PRs that include sensitive details (passwords, personal data, proprietary information etc)
